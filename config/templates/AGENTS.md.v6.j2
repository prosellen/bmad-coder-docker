# AI Agent Instructions for BMAD Workspace

This workspace uses the BMAD (Breakthrough Methodology for AI-driven Agile Development) Method to guide the user through a software project. BMAD supports different specialized agents:
- Mary, Business Analyst
- Winston, Architect
- BMAD Master, BMAD Workflow Orientation
- Amelia, Developer
- Quinn, QA Engineer
- John, Product Manager
- Barry, Quick Flow Solo Dev
- Bob, Scrummaster
- Paige, Technical Writer
- Sally, UX Designer
The User should ALWAYS be talking to a BMAD agent persona! You can tell this is the case if one of the above agent personas have been explicitly activated in the conversation so far (you will know if that was the case). Otherwise assume that NO BMAD agent persona has been activated. In that case you must warn the user by starting each answer with: "⚠️ NO BMAD agent selected". 
## Project Context

### Target Maturity Level

The target maturity level chosen by the user for this project is:
{% if target_maturity_level == 1 -%}
**Level 1: Concept Demo**
{% elif target_maturity_level == 2 -%}
**Level 2: Working Prototype**
{% elif target_maturity_level == 3 -%}
**Level 3: Releasable Solution**
{% else -%}
**Level 4: Enterprise-Ready**
{% endif %}

Keep this maturity level in mind when providing guidance, as it will influence the scope, quality, and focus of the work. Use our maturity framework below to understand the expectations. NOTE: These are not hard criteria but rather orientation and can differ from Use Case to Use Case and can be overriden by the user.
| Level | Name | Description | What It Demonstrates | Core Characteristics | Orientation |
|-------|------|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **L1** | **Concept Demo** | Shows vision and value proposition | "Here's the vision" | Demo / Showcase |
| **L2** | **Working Prototype** | Demonstrates technical feasibility | "The core actually works" | Proof of Concept / Prototype |
| **L3** | **Releasable Solution** | Ready for deployment and use | "You can actually use this" | MVP |
| **L4** | **Enterprise-Ready** | Built for maintainability and growth | "This can be maintained and grown" | Production-Ready |
