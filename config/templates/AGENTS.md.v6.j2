# AI Agent Instructions for BMAD Workspace

This workspace uses the **BMAD Method v6** (Build, Measure, Analyze, Design) to guide software development projects.

## Project Context

### Target Maturity Level

{% if target_maturity_level == 1 -%}
**Level 1: Concept Demo**

This project is a proof-of-concept or demo intended to validate ideas and explore feasibility. Focus on:
- Quick iterations and experimentation
- Core functionality demonstrations
- Minimal documentation (just enough to understand the concept)
- Informal code structure acceptable
- No production-readiness requirements
{% elif target_maturity_level == 2 -%}
**Level 2: Working Prototype**

This project is a functional prototype to validate technical approaches. Focus on:
- Working end-to-end functionality
- Basic error handling
- Moderate code quality and structure
- Essential documentation for handoff
- Some testing of critical paths
- Not yet production-ready but demonstrates viability
{% elif target_maturity_level == 3 -%}
**Level 3: Releasable Solution**

This project aims to be production-ready for initial release. Focus on:
- Complete feature implementation
- Comprehensive error handling
- Good code quality, maintainability, and structure
- Full documentation (technical and user)
- Thorough testing (unit, integration, e2e)
- Security considerations addressed
- Deployment readiness
{% else -%}
**Level 4: Enterprise-Ready**

This project must meet enterprise standards for production deployment. Focus on:
- Production-grade implementation
- Robust error handling and recovery
- Excellent code quality with architectural patterns
- Complete documentation suite (technical, operational, user)
- Comprehensive test coverage with automated testing
- Security hardening and compliance
- Monitoring, logging, and observability
- Scalability and performance optimization
- Disaster recovery and high availability

## BMAD v6 Architecture

### Module Structure

BMAD v6 uses a modular architecture with:
- **Core Module**: Base functionality and configuration
- **BMM Module**: BMAD Method Module with agents, workflows, and development guidance
- **Configuration**: See `_bmad/core/config.yaml` and `_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` for settings

### Available Agents

The BMM module provides specialized agents for different development roles:
- **BMAD Master**: Orchestrates the overall BMAD process
- **Developer**: Implements features and writes code
- **Architect**: Designs system architecture and technical solutions
- **Business Analyst**: Gathers and documents requirements
- **Product Manager**: Defines product vision and priorities
- **QA Engineer**: Tests and validates quality
- **DevOps Engineer**: Manages deployment and infrastructure
- **Data Specialist**: Handles data architecture and management
- **UX/UI Designer**: Designs user interfaces and experiences

See `_bmad/bmm/agents/` for detailed agent definitions.

### Workflows

Development workflows are organized by project phase:
- **Phase 1**: Analysis and discovery
- **Phase 2**: Planning and design
- **Phase 3**: Implementation
- **Phase 4**: Validation and release
- **Phase 5**: Operations and maintenance

See `_bmad/bmm/workflows/` for workflow definitions.

## Configuration

Your workspace is configured with the following settings (managed in config files):

- **User Name**: Configured in `_bmad/core/config.yaml`
- **Communication Language**: Configured in `_bmad/core/config.yaml`
- **Document Output Language**: Configured in `_bmad/core/config.yaml`
- **Project Name**: Configured in `_bmad/bmm/config.yaml`
- **User Skill Level**: Configured in `_bmad/bmm/config.yaml`

These configuration files are automatically updated when workspace parameters change.

## Guidelines for AI Assistance

### Communication Style

Adapt your communication based on the user's skill level (configured in BMM config):
- **No skills**: Explain concepts in plain language, avoid jargon
- **Beginner**: Use common terms but explain advanced concepts
- **Intermediate**: Use technical terminology freely, focus on design decisions
- **Advanced**: Use precise technical language, discuss architecture and optimizations

### Code Quality Expectations

{% if target_maturity_level == 1 -%}
- Prioritize speed and functionality over perfect structure
- Basic comments for non-obvious code
- Manual testing is acceptable
{% elif target_maturity_level == 2 -%}
- Follow basic best practices and patterns
- Document key decisions and approaches
- Include basic unit tests for core functionality
{% elif target_maturity_level == 3 -%}
- Apply SOLID principles and design patterns
- Comprehensive documentation and tests
- Code reviews and quality checks required
{% else -%}
- Enterprise-grade code with full documentation
- Comprehensive test suites (unit, integration, e2e)
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Security auditing and compliance validation
{% endif %}

### Best Practices

1. **Context First**: Review agent definitions and workflows before making suggestions
2. **Consistency**: Follow established patterns in the codebase
3. **Documentation**: Update docs in `_bmad-output/` when making significant changes
4. **Testing**: {% if target_maturity_level >= 3 %}Include tests with all new features{% elif target_maturity_level == 2 %}Add tests for critical paths{% else %}Test manually as needed{% endif %}
5. **Module Configuration**: Respect settings in `_bmad/*/config.yaml` files
6. **Quality**: Align code quality with the target maturity level

## Output Artifacts

BMAD v6 organizes outputs in:
- **Planning Artifacts**: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/`
- **Implementation Artifacts**: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/`
- **Project Knowledge**: `docs/`
