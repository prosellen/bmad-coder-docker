# AI Agent Instructions for BMAD Workspace

This workspace uses the **BMAD Method v4** (Build, Measure, Analyze, Design) to guide software development projects.

## Project Context

### Target Maturity Level

{% if target_maturity_level == 1 -%}
**Level 1: Concept Demo**

This project is a proof-of-concept or demo intended to validate ideas and explore feasibility. Focus on:
- Quick iterations and experimentation
- Core functionality demonstrations
- Minimal documentation (just enough to understand the concept)
- Informal code structure acceptable
- No production-readiness requirements
{% elif target_maturity_level == 2 -%}
**Level 2: Working Prototype**

This project is a functional prototype to validate technical approaches. Focus on:
- Working end-to-end functionality
- Basic error handling
- Moderate code quality and structure
- Essential documentation for handoff
- Some testing of critical paths
- Not yet production-ready but demonstrates viability
{% elif target_maturity_level == 3 -%}
**Level 3: Releasable Solution**

This project aims to be production-ready for initial release. Focus on:
- Complete feature implementation
- Comprehensive error handling
- Good code quality, maintainability, and structure
- Full documentation (technical and user)
- Thorough testing (unit, integration, e2e)
- Security considerations addressed
- Deployment readiness
{% else -%}
**Level 4: Enterprise-Ready**

This project must meet enterprise standards for production deployment. Focus on:
- Production-grade implementation
- Robust error handling and recovery
- Excellent code quality with architectural patterns
- Complete documentation suite (technical, operational, user)
- Comprehensive test coverage with automated testing
- Security hardening and compliance
- Monitoring, logging, and observability
- Scalability and performance optimization
- Disaster recovery and high availability
{% endif %}

### User Technical Proficiency

{% if user_technical_proficiency == 1 -%}
**No Technical Software Development Skills**

The user has no software development experience. When interacting:
- Avoid technical jargon; explain concepts in plain language
- Provide step-by-step instructions for any actions
- Explain *what* you're doing and *why* in simple terms
- Offer to explain technical concepts when they arise
- Focus on outcomes and business value rather than implementation details
- Provide visual aids or analogies where helpful
{% elif user_technical_proficiency == 2 -%}
**Beginner Level**

The user has basic software development knowledge but limited practical experience. When interacting:
- Use common technical terms but explain advanced concepts
- Provide context for decisions and approaches
- Offer learning opportunities and explain best practices
- Be patient with questions about fundamentals
- Suggest resources for deeper understanding when relevant
- Balance explanation with implementation
{% elif user_technical_proficiency == 3 -%}
**Intermediate Level**

The user has solid software development experience and understands common patterns. When interacting:
- Use technical terminology freely
- Focus on design decisions and trade-offs
- Provide rationale for non-obvious choices
- Assume familiarity with standard tools and practices
- Engage in technical discussions
- Suggest optimizations and improvements
{% else -%}
**Advanced Level**

The user is an experienced developer with deep technical knowledge. When interacting:
- Use precise technical language and domain terminology
- Discuss architectural patterns, trade-offs, and optimization strategies
- Focus on nuances, edge cases, and advanced considerations
- Assume strong understanding of best practices
- Engage in high-level technical discussions
- Provide detailed technical rationale for complex decisions
{% endif %}

## BMAD v4 Configuration

### Document Structure

The project uses the following document structure:
- **PRD (Product Requirements)**: `docs/prd.md` (sharded in `docs/prd/`)
- **Architecture**: `docs/architecture.md` (sharded in `docs/architecture/`)
- **QA Documents**: `docs/qa/`
- **User Stories**: `docs/stories/`
- **Debug Log**: `.ai/debug-log.md`

### Key Development Files

Always load these files when working on development tasks:
- `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` - Coding conventions and standards
- `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md` - Technology choices and rationale
- `docs/architecture/source-tree.md` - Project structure and organization

### BMAD v4 Features

- **Markdown Exploder**: Enabled - supports sharded documentation
- **PRD Version**: v4 with sharding support
- **Architecture Version**: v4 with sharding support
- **Slash Command Prefix**: Use `BMad` for BMAD-specific commands

## Working with AI Agents

### Communication Style

{% if user_technical_proficiency <= 2 -%}
- Keep explanations clear and educational
- Break down complex tasks into smaller steps
- Confirm understanding before proceeding with implementation
{% else -%}
- Provide concise, technically accurate responses
- Focus on delivering value efficiently
- Ask clarifying questions for ambiguous requirements
{% endif %}

### Code Quality Expectations

{% if target_maturity_level == 1 -%}
- Prioritize speed and functionality over perfect structure
- Basic comments for non-obvious code
- Manual testing is acceptable
{% elif target_maturity_level == 2 -%}
- Follow basic best practices and patterns
- Document key decisions and approaches
- Include basic unit tests for core functionality
{% elif target_maturity_level == 3 -%}
- Apply SOLID principles and design patterns
- Comprehensive documentation and tests
- Code reviews and quality checks required
{% else -%}
- Enterprise-grade code with full documentation
- Comprehensive test suites (unit, integration, e2e)
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Security auditing and compliance validation
{% endif %}

## Guidelines for AI Assistance

1. **Context First**: Always review relevant documentation before making suggestions
2. **Consistency**: Follow established patterns in the codebase
3. **Documentation**: Update docs when making significant changes
4. **Testing**: {% if target_maturity_level >= 3 %}Include tests with all new features{% elif target_maturity_level == 2 %}Add tests for critical paths{% else %}Test manually as needed{% endif %}
5. **Communication**: Adapt explanations to user's proficiency level
6. **Quality**: Align code quality with the target maturity level
